# Z-stack Image Analysis Project
This project aims to analyze Z-stack images for training. The goal is to quantitate the entire nuclear signal in the green channel (488), differentiate cells with a red ring around the nucleus from those without, and determine any difference in intensity in the 488 channel between these two different populations in the KASH+doxy images.

## Dataset
The dataset contains Z-stack images, 40x. The nuclear stain used is far red (Cy5 650).

## Objectives
The objectives of this project are:

Quantitate the entire nuclear signal in the green channel (488).

Separate cells with a red ring around the nucleus from cells without the ring.

Determine if there is a difference in intensity in the 488 channel between the two different populations in the KASH+doxy images.

Please note that we should not see the red ring in the KASH images.

## Methods
Details about the methods used for analysis will be updated here once established.

## Results
The results of this analysis will be documented here once the project is completed.
